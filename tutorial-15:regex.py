stay motivated and to grow your abilities in the long run.Many Pythonistas I know are struggling with this.It's simply a lot less
fun to build your Python skills completely alone.If you're a self-taught developer with a non-technical day job it's hard to grow
your skills all by yourself.And with no coders in your personal peer group, there's nobody to encourage or support you in your
endeavor of becoming a better developer.'''
