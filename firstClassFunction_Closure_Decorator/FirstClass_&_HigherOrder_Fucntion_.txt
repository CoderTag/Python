First class objects in a language are handled uniformly throughout.
They may be stored in data structures, passed as arguments, or used in control structures.
A programming language is said to support first - class functions if it treats functions as first - class objects.
In computer science, a programming language is said to have first - class functions if it treats functions as first - class citizens.
This means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions,
and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.
[1] Some programming language theorists require support for anonymous functions(function literals) as well.
[2] In languages with first - class functions, the names of functions do not have any special status
they are treated like ordinary variables with a function type.

First - class citizen (Programming)
a first - class citizen (also type, object, entity, or value) in a given programming language is an entity which supports all the
operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a
function, modified, and assigned to a variable.

Higher order functions
A higher order function is a function that takes another function as an input, returns a function or does both.

Put simply: decorators wrap a function, modifying its behavior.
